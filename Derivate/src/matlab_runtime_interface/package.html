<title>MatlabRuntimeInterface package - Accessing Matlab from Java via the
Java Runtime</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="white">
This package provides a basic interface to start a Matlab process 
and communicate with it. In this approach, the Java Runtime class is 
used to establish the link. Communication is achieved through acquiring 
Matlab's standard input and output streams.
